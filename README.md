# üõí Super Store Sales ‚Äì MySQL Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project is built around a **Super Store Sales** dataset stored in MySQL.  
It demonstrates how to design relational tables, insert real-world style data, and run queries to extract valuable insights such as **customer behavior, sales performance, and satisfaction analysis**.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database & Table Creation
The SQL script creates a database named **`super_store_sales`** with the following schema:

- **Transactions**  
  - Stores purchase data: `Customer_ID`, `Product_Name`, `Unit_Price`, `Units_Sold`, `Discount_Applied`, `Total_Revenue`, `Date`, and `Payment_Method`.  
  - Acts as the core sales record table.  

- **Customer_Details**  
  - Contains customer demographics: `Customer_ID`, `Store_Location`, `Email_Address`, `Phone_Number`, `Membership_Tier`.  
  - Includes **unique constraints** on `Email_Address` and `Phone_Number`.  
  - Linked to `Transactions` via `Customer_ID` (foreign key).  

- **Customer_Support**  
  - Stores customer interactions: `Customer_ID`, `Email_Address`, `Feedback_Type`, and `Satisfaction_Rating`.  
  - Useful for analyzing **customer experience vs purchase behavior**.
